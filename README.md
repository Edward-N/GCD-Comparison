# GCD-Comparison

In the following program, the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) iterations are compared between Consecutive Integer Checking and Euclidean's Algorithm. Both algorithms are given the same set of numbers which range from 2,000 to 200,000. There are 100 different pairs that are run through the driver program. The driver program implements those pairs of numbers for both algorithms. The algorithms after each iteration return the number of iterations it took to solve the GCD. A set of counters are set for both algorithms which contain the highest number of iterations, the lowest number of iterations, and the average number of iterations in consideration to all 100 pairs. The program concludes that Euclidean Algorithm does less work (less number of iterations when the numbers compared are higher in value) as for Consecutive Integer Checking it does less work on numbers that are lower in value.
